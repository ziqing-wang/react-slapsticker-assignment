            <p>
                Hello candidate, Welcome to our little dev test. The goal of this
                exercise, is to asses your general skill level, and give us
                something to talk about at our next appointment.
            </p>

                <h3>What this app should do</h3>
                <p>
                    SlapSticker is an app that lets users to slap stickers on their
                    face, using their webcam. Functionality wise the app works, but
                    the ui needs some love. We'd like for you to extend this
                    prototype to make it look and feel it bit better.
                </p>
                <p>These are the basic requirements:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>User can pick a sticker</li>
                    <li>User can give the captured image a title</li>
                    <li>User can place the sticker over the webcam image</li>
                    <li>User can capture the webcam image with sticker</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>What we want you to do</h3>
                <p>
                    Off course we didn't expect you to build a full fledged app in
                    such a short time frame. That's why the basic requirements are
                    already implemented.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, we would like for you to show off your strengths as a
                    developer by improving the app.
                </p>
                <p>Some ideas (no need to do all):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Make it look really nice</li>
                    <li>Let users pick from multiple (custom) stickers</li>
                    <li>Improve the workflow and ux</li>
                    <li>Show multiple captured images in a gallery</li>
                    <li>Let users download or share the captured pics</li>
                    <li>Add super cool effects to webcam feed</li>
                    <li>Organize, document and test the code</li>
                    <li>Integrate with zoom, teams, meet...</li>
                </ul>
